"Table S4: Macroevolutionary correlates of interspecific variation in white tails. Shown are the results of a Bayesian phylogenetic logistic regression, computed in MCMCglmm. Statistically significant coefficients are highlighted in grey. Note that no Anomaluromorphs have white tails, and there was an insufficient sample size to run these models in the Scuriomorpha. Note also that the Castorimorpha do not contain any arboreal species or any social group sizes beyond ""1"" and ""2"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
