"Table S5: Macroevolutionary correlates of interspecific variation in white tail tips. Shown are the results of a Bayesian phylogenetic logistic regression, computed in MCMCglmm. Statistically significant coefficients are highlighted in grey. Note that no Anomaluromorphs have white tail tips. Note also that the Castorimorpha do not contain any arboreal species or any social group sizes beyond ""1"" and ""2"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
