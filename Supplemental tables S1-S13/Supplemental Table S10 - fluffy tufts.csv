"Table S10: Macroevolutionary correlates of interspecific variation in fluffy tail tufts. Shown are the results of a Bayesian phylogenetic logistic regression, computed in MCMCglmm. Statistically significant coefficients are highlighted in grey.  Note insufficient trait variation in the Anomaluromorpha. Note also that the Castorimorpha do not contain any arboreal species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
