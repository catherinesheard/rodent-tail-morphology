"Table S7: Macroevolutionary correlates of interspecific variation in contrasting tail tips. Shown are the results of a Bayesian phylogenetic logistic regression, computed in MCMCglmm. Statistically significant coefficients are highlighted in grey. Note that there is not enough trait variation in the Anomaluromorpha to run meaningful models for contrasting tail tips. Note also that the Castorimorpha do not contain any arboreal species or any social group sizes beyond ""1"" and ""2"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
