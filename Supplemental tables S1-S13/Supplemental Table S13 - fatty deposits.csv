"Table S13: Macroevolutionary correlates of interspecific variation in fatty tail deposits. Shown are the results of a Bayesian phylogenetic logistic regression, computed in MCMCglmm. Note that the suborders Anomaluromorpha, Castorimorpha, Hystricomorpha, and Scuriomorpha all contain <  5 species with fatty tail deposits and were thus omitted from analysis.",,,,,,,,,,
